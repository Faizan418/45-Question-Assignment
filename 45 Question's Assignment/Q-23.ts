/*Question_23:--- Conditional Tests: 
Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.*/

let myCar = "alto";
console.log(myCar == "alto");

//Single (=) is used for assigning and Dubble (==) is used for comparision

//  10 Statements true and false...

let myfrut = "Apple";
console.log(myfrut == "Apple");
console.log(myfrut == "apple");
